Getting Started
===============

In this guide, we're going to learn some basics about Estoult, such as creating, reading, updating and destroying records from a PostgreSQL database.

This guide will require you to have setup PostgreSQL beforehand.

Installing
----------

To install the latest version, hosted on PyPI:

.. code-block:: text

   pip install estoult

If you are using SQLite you don't need to install anything else. Otherwise you need to have the correct database driver installed:

* PostgreSQL: `psycopg2 <http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/install.html#installation>`_
* MySQL: `mysqlclient <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mysqlclient/>`_
