Estoult
=======

Estoult is a Python toolkit for data mapping with an integrated query builder for SQL databases. It currently supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.

Features:

- Not an ORM. Estoult treats the data, not objects, as first class citizens.
- Concise and composable (sub)queries.
- Easy debugging by displaying any generated SQL in a readable format.
- Performant as raw SQL. Estoult is **NOT** an ORM.

Estoult's source code is located at `GitHub <https://github.com/halcyonnouveau/estoult>`_.
